The packer with UI that sprite really packs uh a grid...
Free ChatGPT made this.

Automatically resizes selected images to have same max size and then aligns them in a grid with variable padding and max elements per row.

## Requirements
Pretty much just Python (3 I guess), `os, tkinter and PIL`.

## Installation
1. Download it
2. Run it

## Usage
1. Run the script
2. Select images (I think rn only PNGs are supported, I want to add SVG support eventually)
3. Set up settings
4. Compose and Preview
5. Edit again or save if you're happy.
